# Manual Cleanup Instructions

## Legacy Directories to Remove

Please manually delete these legacy directories that are no longer needed:

1. **`analytics-ui/`** - Legacy analytics interface (replaced by merged features in action-ui)
2. **`z-trader-action-ui/`** - Legacy action interface (replaced by action-ui)

## Clean Project Structure

After removing the legacy directories, your project structure should be:

```
flip-safe/
â”œâ”€â”€ action-ui/                    # ðŸŽ¯ UNIFIED APPLICATION
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Simulator.js      # From analytics-ui
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AdminConsole.js   # From analytics-ui  
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Orders/           # Trading features

â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helpers/              # API helpers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js                        # Express server
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json                  # Main package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README_SETUP.md              # Updated documentation
â””â”€â”€ [server files...]
```

## Commands to Delete (run from project root):

```bash
rm -rf analytics-ui
rm -rf z-trader-action-ui
```

## Verification

After cleanup, confirm these commands work:

```bash
npm run install-all    # Install dependencies
npm run dev           # Start server + UI
```

The unified application should run on:
- Backend: http://localhost:3000  
- Frontend: http://localhost:3098
